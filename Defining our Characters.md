Defining our Characters


Core Character Traits of World-Class Engineering Teams
1. Intellectual Honesty

They tell the truth about reality, even when it’s uncomfortable.

They say “I don’t know” quickly instead of bluffing.

They debug facts, not opinions.

They rewrite their own assumptions constantly.

Every conversation is:

“What’s the evidence?”

2. Calm, Slow Thinking Under Pressure

They do not panic in incidents.

They default to root cause, not symptom patching.

They keep a notebook or doc of their thought process (engineers who think in tree diagrams > engineers who think in fragments).

During incidents:

“Pause. Observe. Measure. Then act.”

3. Small-Ego Collaboration

Ideas are judged on merit, not origin.

Losing an argument is considered winning, because the team found truth.

The best idea wins. Not the loudest voice.

Team vibe in code review:

“We fight the code together, not each other.”

4. Relentless Curiosity

They study other systems.

They benchmark competitors.

They read RFCs and docs for fun.

Many read technical postmortems the way others read gossip columns.

These are the engineers who ask “why” until everyone else is tired.

5. Pride in Craft

Clean code is not aesthetics; it’s long-term velocity.

They’d rather write one elegant line than 50 clever hacks.

They refactor continuously, not “later.”

Good teams think in decades, not sprints.

6. Ruthless Prioritization

They ignore 90% of tasks.

They know “busy” ≠ “productive”.

They measure work by user impact, not story points closed.

Their motto:

“If everything is important, nothing is.”

7. Feedback Habit (Daily, Not Annual)

Feedback is fast, respectful, and specific.

They review behavior and decisions, not personality.

They view feedback as a gift, not a threat.

Example phrasing:

“I think there’s a simpler version of this. Want to explore?”

8. High Ownership & Responsibility

If a system breaks, they don’t say “not my code”.

They own production behavior, not just pull requests.

They monitor outcomes, not output.

They feel emotionally responsible for their users.

9. Learning Velocity > Talent

They measure growth curve, not snapshot skill level.

Reading documentation, writing internal guides, teaching juniors — this is admired, not optional.

The mindset:

“We level up together.”

Habits of Elite Engineering Teams
Habit	What It Looks Like	Why It Matters
Daily small deploys	5–30 deployments per day, automated rollback	Reduces failure blast radius, increases momentum
Write design docs before coding	1–3 page documents; reviewed collaboratively	Prevents wasted engineering effort
Blameless postmortems	Focus on systems, not people	Encourages transparency & learning
Pairing on hard problems	Two engineers + one keyboard on critical complexity	Higher clarity & knowledge transfer
Clear “Definition of Done”	Tests, monitoring, rollback plan, docs, code review	Prevents half-built systems
Metrics-driven engineering	Track latency, error rate, deploy frequency, MTTR	Ensures engineering = business performance
Public, shared team knowledge	Internal wikis, recorded decisions, shared context	Eliminates “tribal knowledge bottlenecks”
The Emotional Tones You Feel in a Great Team

(This is the stuff you notice walking through the office / Slack)

Calm confidence – no frantic chaos.

Clarity in speech – short, precise, well-reasoned statements.

Playfulness – inside jokes, meme threads, shared humor.

No fear of looking dumb – people ask “basic” questions freely.

Respect for time – short meetings, long focus blocks.

A world-class engineering org feels like a jazz band, not a marching band.
